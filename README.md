# Upcloud & Doom

This is a solution for running the original [Doom](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom) game on a Kubernetes cluster on [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/). The solution involves building a Docker image that runs the game (along with a virtual X server and VNC or noVNC for remote access), pushing the image to a registry, and then deploying it via Kubernetes.

> [!TIP]
> The repo has been put together as a demonstration of the process and is not intended for production use. I know you can deploy the game i.e. directly on the UpCloud managed server, but where is the fun in that.
> You can adapt the approach for any retro open source game if you prefer or use it as a enjoyable starter with the running game at the end before you dive into your kubernetes deployment.

The repository contains 2 approaches how you can put everything together:

- Easy one -> More in [Getting Started](#getting-started---easy-one)
  - jut take community image (or mine)
  - publisj it to UÃºpCloud Managed Kubernetes Cluster
- Tha hard way -> More in [Build from scratch](#build-from-scratch---the-hard-way)
  - google around
  - make your own image with Doom & web browser gaming system
  - publish it to UÃºpCloud Managed Kubernetes Cluster

## Prerequisites (Just to run it)

- [UpCloud account](https://upcloud.com/) charged with at least 10 EUR to enable kubernetes pods
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed
- [ðŸ‘€ READ THIS - they have nice pictures!](https://upcloud.com/docs/guides/get-started-managed-kubernetes/)

## Getting Started - Easy One

1.  Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Simply007/upcloud-doom.git
    cd upcloud-doom
    ```

1.  Get your Kubernetes configuration file (`doom-dev_kubeconfig.yaml` in example) from UpCloud kubernetes (`doom-dev` in example).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You can do it via the [UpCloud CLI `upctl`](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli)) or the UpCloud portal, but the CLI is not in the requirements, so do this [via the portal if](https://upcloud.com/docs/guides/get-started-managed-kubernetes/#connecting-to-the-cluster) you go step by step and name the file `doom-dev_kubeconfig.yaml` and put it in the root of this repo.

    > As Upcloud says
    > The kubeconfig file is a convenient way to organise information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms.
    > UpCloud provides you with separate kubeconfig file for each of your clusters.
    > You can configure the kubeconfig file, for example, with our [ `upctl` command-line client](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli) or by downloading the kubeconfig file manually.

    ```sh
    upctl k8s cluster kubeconfig get doom-dev > doom-dev_kubeconfig.yaml
    # or in the dail of the cluster in the UpCloud portal portal
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > The kubeconfig file contains sensitive information about your cluster and should be kept secure.
    > Do not share it with others or commit it to a public repository -> hence the `.gitignore` in the repo

1.  Export the kubeconfig file

    ```sh
    export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/doom-dev_kubeconfig.yaml
    ```

1.  Run the game

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > There is also a `deployment-novnc.yaml` deployment file that uses [mattipaksula/http-doom:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattipaksula/http-doom) image that requires no VNC and WebSockets - it stream JPEG images to the browser. 
    > You can try it out by running `kubectl apply -f deployment-novnc.yaml` instead.

1.  Wait & fet the service IP

    This bit will take a moment.

    You can keep an eye on the services with the next command to see when the app becomes available.

    ```sh
    kubectl get svc chocolate-doom-service -w
    ```

1.  Open the service in your browser `http://<service-ip>/vnc.html` (and `http://<service-ip>/` for the noVNC version)


ðŸŽ‰ You made it - hit connect and play

## Build from scratch - the hard way

Thi section describes How I did and prepared this what I did to prepare the easy way for moth my setup and community-image-based image deployment.

- Analysis
  The solution involves building a Docker image that runs the game (along with a virtual X server and VNC or noVNC for remote access), pushing the image to a registry, and then deploying it via Kubernetes. You can adapt the approach for any retro open source game if you prefer.
- choose Chocolate Doom and read through the setup

Chocolate Doom is an open source port of the original Doom engine. Because Doom is a graphical game, youâ€™ll need a way to run it headlessly on a server and view its output remotely. One common approach is to use a virtual framebuffer (using Xvfb) and serve the display via a VNC server or a browser-based solution like noVNC.

Pick a WAD see [Gotchas](#gotchas) for more info.

- build a Docker image

put together a Dockerfile that installs Chocolate Doom, Xvfb, and a VNC server.

see [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)

```sh
# docker build -t simply007/chocolate-doom:latest . # only linux/arm64/v8
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t simply007/chocolate-doom:latest .
```

- Push the image to a registry

```sh
docker push simply007/chocolate-doom:latest
```

- The solution is based on the assumption that you have a Kubernetes cluster running on UpCloud. If you donâ€™t have one, you can follow the instructions in the [UpCloud Kubernetes guide](https://upcloud.com/community/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/).

- prepare

- deploy the image via Kubernetes

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

- analyze the process

```sh
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod chocolate-doom-5495bff8d6-cdhsr
kubectl get svc chocolate-doom-service # or  kubectl get services -w
```

## Handy commands

### Get the pods

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

### Get the logs

```sh
kubectl logs <POD_NAME>
```

### Run a command in the pod

```sh
kubectl exec -it <POD_NAME> -- /bin/bash
```

### Get the service IP

```sh
kubectl get svc chocolate-doom-service
# or kubeclt get services -w for watching all services
```

### Delete the deployment

```sh
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```

### Open shell in the pod

```sh
kubectl exec -it <POD_NAME> -- /bin/bash
```

## Gotchas

During the process, I encountered a few fails that you might want to be aware of:

### upctl vs kubectl

UpCloud provides a CLI for all of the

- `upctl` is being treatherd as a typo (kubectl) - this can be handled by sending the inquiry to google (had thew same with Kontent keyword)
- mention export `KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/doom-dev_kubeconfig.yaml`

### UpCloud trial restrictions

- pushing on kubernetes: Kubernetes pods are currently disabled during trial. Please contact UpCloud support, or make a one-time payment of â‚¬10 or more to remove trial account restrictions.

### Docker platform and buildx

- issue without getting the image from the dockerhub `Failed to pull image "simply007/chocolate-doom:latest": failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/simply007/chocolate-doom:latest": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/simply007/chocolate-doom:latest": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed` => I build it on MAC, but the cluster on UpcLoud is accepting amd64 => so I needed to make a multiarch build

### Doom alternatives

- couls have used any prepared image from dockerhub (i.e. https://hub.docker.com/r/mattipaksula/http-doom), but that would cut out the the path and talking points

findind the WAD file - I did not want to use the original WAD file, so I needed to find a free one - I found one on https://freedoom.github.io/download.html. Some of the alternatives were not compatible, or license was not permissii

### Managed Kubernetes vs. self-hosted

- Error from server: Get "https://10.0.0.2:10250/containerLogs/default/chocolate-doom-54fdbbd57f-spxlf/chocolate-doom": No agent available -> most of the time when getting logs, running commands

### Game setup

- WEBSOCKET DID NOT WORK ON OTHER PORT THAN 80 - so using other port for noVNC was not possible - I dod not investigate further
- sound bug -> MIDI player not configured - the sound and it's setting were hard to configure and digging deeper on the MIDI player was worth a hustle for this showcase, but deffinitely something to consider when you want to stream any sound
- keyboard binding overrides - when you have your keyboard setup as usin control + arrow up to display Mission COntrol and want got upfronr and shoot - guess what happened ? :-)
- The startup of the service can lead to the state that not everythin is up and running on time - to overcome that and start with some MVP and keep the flow running I pimped the Dockerfile with a couple of sleep commands. Of course - this is something I would come back to and identify where and for what should I use for the readiness
